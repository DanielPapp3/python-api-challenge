# python-api-challenge

This repo contains the results of an analysis on a couple different API requests, "WeatherPy" and "VacationPy" that were obtained by using a variety of python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, and citipy as well as the OpenWeatherMap API and ???. The data sets used can be found in the form of a CSV file within the "output_data" folder within this repository. The png figures required for this assignment can also be found in the "output_data" folder within this repository.

The analysis looked at data from the data records of a hypothetical school district. The objective was to find trends to use in order to help the district make decisions regarding priorities and budget. You can find the results of this analysis by navigating to the text file entitled "PyCitySchools.ipynb" located in the "pandas-challenge/PyCitySchools" folder within this repository.
