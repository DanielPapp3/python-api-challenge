# python-api-challenge

This repo contains the results of an analysis on a couple different API requests, "WeatherPy" and "VacationPy" that were obtained by using a variety of python libraries including pandas, matplotlib, numpy, scipy, and citipy as well as the OpenWeatherMap API and GeoApify API. The data sets used can be found in the form of a CSV file within the "output_data" folder within this repository. The png figures required for this assignment can also be found in the "output_data" folder within this repository.

The objective was to find hotels located within 10,000 meters of a location that was experiencing what the developer considered to be ideal weather conditions (in the case of the VacationPy exercise) and ???. You can find the results of the VacationPy analysis by navigating to the Jupyter Notebook file entitled "VacationPy.ipynb" located in the "pandas-challenge/VacationPy" folder within this repository. You can find the results of the WeatherPy analysis by navigating to the Jupyter Notebook file entitled "WeatherPy.ipynb" located in this repository.
